# 8-2 Journal: Portfolio Submission

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want to design?
The DriverPass project is about a client searching for software solutions to maintaining the DriverPass program. They required a comprehensive software application that may manage
customer registration, reservation scheduling, payment processing, and management systems from the DriverPass project. However, DriverPass was the client and the system they wanted
me to design was creating a seamless experience for their customers and make sure the software becomes efficient and friendly to users.

# What did you do particulary well?
Being able to outline the requirements of a client clearly while translating them into technical specifications as the main important point, carefully paying attention to specific
details, verifying that each aspect of the software’s functionality was documented thoroughly, and emphasizing the significance of user experience in the design, aligning additional
features with the client’s vision were the things I particularly did well on. However, there are some aspects of working through this design document. It requires working through the 
design document that immensely aided in giving a structured approach to the software development process. However, there are some aspects of working through this design document. It 
requires working through the design document that immensely aided in giving a structured approach to the software development process. However, the document served as a roadmap, 
providing guidance to the development team and making sure that everybody had shared an understanding of the project requirements. Overall, it facilitated effective communication 
and better collaboration among our team members.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to choose one part of my work on those documents for revision, it could be the part related to error handling/edge cases. I would improve that by trusting a huge comprehensive
investigation of potential errors and how the system must respond to them establishes the robustness of this document while addressing the common scenarios. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
Interpreting user needs became super essential in shaping the software design. It is so important to consider the user’s needs while designing because understanding the client’s business 
model, their target audience, and their expectations have allowed me to design additional characteristics that catered to their customers directly. According to the situation, organizing 
the user needs made sure the final product was considered “intuitive”, making it look mostly like a successful adoption.


# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I made an approach to designing software that included a mix of understanding the client’s requirements, conducting user research, and working through iterative design methods. Although
I focused on creating a user-centered design, performing usability tests, and reviewing feedback to clarify the features of software. As a part of my future life, I decided to improve my 
design skills by searching through UX/UI trends that emerge and include end-users in this design process through usability testing and feedback sessions. 
Thank you for guiding me through this course. I'm looking forward to reviewing the feedback on my work.
Sincerely,
